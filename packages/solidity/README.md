```sh
npx nx build solidity
```

## Lint
```sh
npx nx lint solidity
```

## Run hardhat ts tests
```sh
npx nx test-hardhat solidity
```

## Run foundry sol tests
```sh
npx nx test-foundry solidity
```

## Deploy contracts
```sh
npx nx run solidity:deploy --network <network> scripts/deploy/<script>.ts
```

## Install new libs
From the root directory:
```sh
git submodule add --force --name lib/openzeppelin-contracts https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts packages/solidity/lib/openzeppelin-contracts
```

Then from packages/solidity
```sh
forge remappings > remappings.txt
```

# Networks
There are three configured networks :

- hardhat : Local network (default)
- testnet : [Avalanche Fuji Testnet](https://chainlist.org/chain/43113)

## Contract requirements

### Work Contract

- To be able to sign a work contract you must pass a KYC
- Every work contract have a % retained by the system to prevent faking it (and then faking the reputation system)
  - % retained must be given to DAO and Team wallet for the production and exploitation
- Contract must engage two different address
- Contract must have a snapshot of the contractor address to ensure that he have a % of the amount of money to pay the contract
- Options before contract:
  - take a snapshot of a % of the money of the contractor
  - both party choose the retain %
  - contractor must commit a % in the escrow system
  - both party choose the payment milestones (ie: send x% every x month/week/day)
    - if payment milestones are not done, you can launch a dispute in the Dispute System
  - freelancer must commit a hash of github to ensure the work is done for payment milestones
