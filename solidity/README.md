## Contract requirements

### Work Contract

- To be able to sign a work contract you must pass a KYC
- Every work contract have a % retained by the system to prevent faking it (and then faking the reputation system)
  - % retained must be given to DAO and Team wallet for the production and exploitation
- Contract must engage two different address
- Contract must have a snapshot of the contractor address to ensure that he have a % of the amount of money to pay the contract
- Options before contract:
  - take a snapshot of a % of the money of the contractor
  - both party choose the retain %
  - contractor must commit a % in the escrow system
  - both party choose the payment milestones (ie: send x% every x month/week/day)
    - if payment milestones are not done, you can launch a dispute in the Dispute System
  - freelancer must commit a hash of github to ensure the work is done for payment milestones
